# GenesysWebApp
Web App Designed to help with creating Genesys games from FFG

## Notes
I do not own Genesys, Fantasy Flight Games does. Becaues of this, the system is designed to be generic, storing state in local storage, and saving nothing on the server.

The Games Master will be responsible for filling out everything for his players, and the data that you create for your game is stored only in your local browser. This is an attempt to not duplicate any part of the rules or content owned by Fantasy flight games and nothing in this repo will be copied from the rule books of fantasy flight games.
